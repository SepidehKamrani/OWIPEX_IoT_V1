#set -e makes the script exit on any error.
#sudo apt-get update updates the package lists.
#The script installs Git, Maven, and cURL, which are common dependencies for setting up services.
#It checks for the existence of a project directory and clones or updates the repository as necessary.
#Maven is used to build the project, and PostgreSQL is installed and started.
#A thingsboard database is created, and the PostgreSQL service is restarted.
#Additional placeholder comments suggest where to insert specific commands for configuring ThingsBoard or other services.
#The script ends by checking the status of the PostgreSQL service to ensure it's running properly.
