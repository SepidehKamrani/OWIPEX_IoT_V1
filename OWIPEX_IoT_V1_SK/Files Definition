"""thingsboard_client/: 
- Contains the client code for interfacing with the ThingsBoard API, managing telemetry data, attributes, and RPC.

device_manager/: 
- Manages device communication, including Modbus interactions and specific code for radar, turbidity, and pH sensors.

state_manager/: 
- Manages system configuration and state, potentially eliminating the need for direct file-based state management.

handlers/: 
- Contains modules for specific tasks like GPS data processing and flow rate calculations based on sensor data.

models/: 
- Defines data structures or classes for sensors and actuators, encapsulating their properties and behaviors.

utilities/: 
- Includes utility classes or scripts, such as those for tracking system runtime or other common functions.

main/: 
- Hosts the main application script that orchestrates the initialization and coordination of other modules.

tests/: 
- Contains test cases for the modules, ensuring functionality and stability through unit and integration tests.

docs/: 
- Stores all project documentation, including README, user guides, and developer guides for system setup and usage.

scripts/: 
- Holds miscellaneous scripts like server setup and initialization, alongside JSON configuration data files.

config/: 
- Contains configuration files or templates that set default values and parameters for the system.

data/: 
- If file-based state management is retained, this directory will store such files; otherwise, it may contain database initialization scripts or migration tools.

hardware_interface/: 
- Includes scripts for direct hardware control, such as GPIO manipulation on Linux systems.

deployment/: 
- Contains deployment scripts for setting up edge services and the main server, facilitating the system's installation and setup.

calibration/: 
- Stores calibration data for sensors in JSON format, allowing for accurate readings and measurements.

backup/: 
- Contains backup scripts and copies of important code, ensuring that there is a fallback in case of issues with the current codebase."""
